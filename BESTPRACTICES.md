# Governance Model

# Project Governance Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the governance policy for the [Cortex.io](http://cortex.io/) Plugin Community, establishing roles, responsibilities, and guidelines for contribution, review, and decision-making.

## Project Maintainers

The [Cortex.io](http://cortex.io/) Plugin Community is managed by the following maintainers:

- **Justin Reock** ([justin.reock@cortex.io](mailto:justin.reock@cortex.io))
- **Martin Stone** ([martin.stone@cortex.io](mailto:martin.stone@cortex.io))

Maintainers have the authority to approve and merge pull requests, manage community interactions, and guide the direction of the repository.

## Contributors

- **Fernando Cremer** ([fernando.cremer@cortex.io](mailto:fernando.cremer@cortex.io))

## Contribution Process

1. **Issue Creation**: Community members are encouraged to create issues for bug reports, feature requests, or discussions about new plugin ideas.
2. **Fork and Pull Request (PR)**: Contributions should be made by forking the repository, making changes, and submitting a pull request. Detailed descriptions and references to related issues are encouraged.
3. **Review and Approval**: Each pull request will undergo review by one of the maintainers. Changes may be requested before final approval.
4. **Merge Requirements**: A minimum of one maintainer approval is required to merge pull requests. Maintainers may request additional input from the community as needed.

## Decision-Making

Decisions on major changes or new features will be made by consensus among the maintainers. In cases where consensus cannot be reached, a majority vote among maintainers will decide.

## Code of Conduct

All community members and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-12e68bf8e9e180de9fd1dfdf29a40d86?pvs=21), fostering an inclusive, respectful, and collaborative environment.
